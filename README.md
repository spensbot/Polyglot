# Polyglot

Learn any language

## How it works

Polyglot learns your language level and presents you with real world text that push your knowledge

## Why

Popular language learning apps like Duolingo do a decent job of laying the foundation for learning a language, but they fail to bring learners to the point of conversation. Polyglot bridges the gap between typical language apps and fluency by fleshing out a users grammar and vocab.

## Features

### Pick your native language

Hints and definitions will appear in this language

### Pick a language to learn.

Polyglot will display accessible excerpts of text. Click on words you don't understant. 1 Click displays a hint (if available. E.g. pinyin for chinese). 2 Clicks display the definition

### At Your Level

Polyglot learns the words you do, and don't know, automatically determining your language level, and showing text excerpts that push that level without overwhelming you.

### Difficulty selection

Choose the rate at which you want to be exposed to new words. Polyglot will do its best to find text exerpts that do that.
